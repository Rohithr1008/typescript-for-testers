# Project Handoff â€” TypeScript for Testers (2-Part Thin Kit)

> **Purpose:** Everything a fresh session needs to continue this repo. Read this first.  
> **Scope:** Thin **Phase A** TypeScript for automation testers only. Do **not** expand into full TS develop careers here â€” that is Phase B (`typescript-develop-test`). Do **not** edit `html-css-essentials` or `automation-tester-path` from this workstream unless explicitly asked.

## 1. Overview

ADHD-friendly study kit: types you need for **test helpers, fixtures, and light POM** â€” plus a tiny JSâ†’TS migrate lab and a Playwright+TS overview.

| Part | Title | Sections | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Basics for testers | 10 | Why TS, primitives, interfaces, unions, optional, aliases, pitfalls |
| 2 | Playwright-oriented | 10 | tsconfig, Playwright+TS, POM/helpers, migrate lab, reading errors |

**Status:** Parts 1â€“2 complete (three editions each + hub + labs).

**Repo:** https://github.com/Rohithr1008/typescript-for-testers

## 3. Pedagogy

- Every teaching section: `> ðŸš© **Why it matters:**`
- Three editions per part; quizzes / flashcards / Spot-the-Bug / certificate pattern (thin, like Perf Basics)
- Accent: TypeScript blue `#3178C6`
- Lab is **conceptual compare** (no `tsc` required to study); optional `npx -p typescript tsc --noEmit` if user has TS installed

---

## 4. Out of scope

- Generics / decorators / advanced types rabbit holes
- Full Playwright curriculum (link to playwright-essentials)
- Editing other path kits from WS2

---

## 5. Verification

- Open `index.html` + both study apps in a browser
- Preview interactive MD in VS Code
- Skim `labs/migrate-before.js` vs `labs/migrate-after.ts`

---

## 6. Status

Scaffold + Parts 1â€“2 content + labs + hub docs â€” initial kit complete.
